# [Project-1: Exploratory Data Analysis on India's Statewise Covid-19 Data](https://github.com/jatin-kohar/EDA-India-Covid19-Data)
* In this project, I analysed the extent of Covid-19 spread and its impact on all Indian states and UTs. Further, I attempted to draw conclusions as to the reason why some states were hit harder as compared to others. I individually inspected the death count, death ratio, discharge ratio, active cases and active ratio to reach my conclusions.

Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly
Skills used: Data Exploration, Interactive visualistions

### Summary of Findings:

1) Maharashtra has been the most affected state in the country with the highest number of total and active cases. This alongside a high death rate represents a dire situation of Covid infections in the state.

2) Kerala and Andhra Pradesh are outliers in the Deaths vs Total cases trend. Furthermore, the active ratio of Andhra Pradesh is below the national average Active ratio of 2.58%. This points an efficient healthcare system in the state.

3) The Northeastern states have the lowest discharge ratio. In conjunction to this, the region also has the highest Active ratio. One possible conclusion could be that the outbreak is still spreading in the region and the healthcare facilities need improvement to enhance the discharge ratio.
